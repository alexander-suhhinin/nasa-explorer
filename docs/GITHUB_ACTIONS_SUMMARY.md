## 🔧 Technical Features

### Caching
```yaml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm
      node_modules
      */node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles(env.CACHE_DEPENDENCY_PATH) }}
```

### Conditional Execution
```yaml
if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

### Environments
- **staging** - for develop branch
- **production** - for main branch with protection rules

### Matrix builds
```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    language: [ 'javascript' ]
```
